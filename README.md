### Project Description
[This exam reminder helps you keep track of upcoming tests, ensuring you‚Äôre well-prepared and never miss an important date. Set personalized alerts, organize your study schedule, and stay stress-free.]

### The Problem statement
[Design and develop an Exam Reminder System that enables students to effectively manage their study schedules and stay on top of upcoming tests and exams.]

### The Solution
[This Exam Countdown Timer allows users to input their exam date and time, then calculates and displays the time remaining. It updates every second and, when only 10 seconds remain, shows a random motivational quote and plays an audio clip for encouragement. Once the countdown reaches zero, it displays "Exam Started!" and plays the motivational audio again. üöÄüìö]

# Run
[commands -
          Here are the basic Git commands to get you started:

*Configuration*
1. Set your username:
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```
2. Set your email:
```
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

*Creating a Repository*
1. Create a new Git repository:
```
git init
```
2. Clone an existing repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

*Basic Git Workflow*
1. Add files to the staging area:
```
git add .
```
2. Commit changes:
```
git commit -m "Commit message"
```
3. Push changes to a remote repository:
```
git push origin branch-name
```

*Branching and Merging*
1. Create a new branch:
```
git branch new-branch
```
2. Switch to a branch:
```
git checkout branch-name
```
3. Merge branches:
```
git merge branch-name
```

*Status and Log*

```
git status
```
2. View commit history:
```
git log
```

*Remote Repositories*
1. Add a remote repository:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
```
2. Fetch changes from a remote repository:
```
git fetch origin
```

*Undoing Changes*
1. Undo changes in the staging area:
```
git reset
```
2. Revert a commit:
```
git revert commit-hash
```

These are just the basics, but they should give you a good starting point for working with Git.
   Here are the commands to run HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files:

*Running HTML Files*
To run an HTML file, simply open it in a web browser. You can do this by:

1. Double-clicking the HTML file
2. Right-clicking the HTML file and selecting "Open with" > "Google Chrome" (or your preferred browser)
3. Using the command line:

*Windows*
```
start file.html
```
*macOS (via Terminal)*
```
open file.html
```
*Linux*
```
xdg-open file.html
```

*Running CSS Files*
CSS files are used to style HTML documents and cannot be run independently. However, you can verify that your CSS file is working correctly by opening the associated HTML file in a web browser.

*Running JavaScript Files*
To run a JavaScript file, you'll need to use a JavaScript runtime environment like Node.js. Here's how:

*Using Node.js*
1. Install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/
2. Open a terminal or command prompt
3. Navigate to the directory containing your JavaScript file
4. Run the JavaScript file using Node.js:

```
node file.js
```

Note: Make sure to replace `file.html`, `file.css`, and `file.js` with the actual names of your files.]
